    <h2 class="header_bot", id="About">About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Lucas Faletra. I am an aspiring software engineer/developer graduating with my Bachelor's in Computer Science during May 2021 from the University of Massachusetts Lowell.</p><br>
    <h2 class="header_bot", id="Interests">Interests</h2>
    <p>I really do love creating software. I am most interested in embedded software, machine learning and data science. Eventually, I would like to go back to college to obtain my Master's degree with a focus on Machine Learning
    or artificial intelligence</p><br>
    <h2 class="header_bot", id="Projects">Projects</h2>
    <p>Arch Linux is a distrobution of the Linux operating system with a primary focus on simplicity as well as customization. Arch Linux has no easy installation method.
    As a result, much of the operating system must be configured by the user. After configuring Arch Linux to my likings, I decided to try and optimize the operating system on my machine.
    I was able to get my custom configuration to use just under 300MB of memory when idle. I also shortened boot time by customizing the kernel for my PC. Right now, I am in the process of automating
    installation and configuration of certain files/programs in order to have a backup and/or share this with others. Some config files for my system and the shell script for this installation can be seen
    <a href="https://github.com/LucasFaletra/ARCH">here</a>.</p><br>
    <p>I created this website very recently to make it easier to share my personal projects/coursework with others. Currently, I am in the process
    of learning Javascript. The goal for this website is to eventually be able to showcase some interesting Javascript programs alongside other examples of my work.
    Code for the website can be found on my github <a href="https://github.com/LucasFaletra/LucasFaletra.github.io">in this repository</a>.</p><br>
    <p>
    I have also completed coursework using Microsoft Database, C/C++, Python, x86 Assembly, and numerous other tools/languages.
